/**
 * The divide operator takes 2 sub-expressions which both have single cardinality and numerical base-types.
 * The result is a single float that corresponds to the first expression divided by the second expression.
 * If either of the sub-expressions is NULL then the operator results in NULL.
 * <p>
 * Item authors should make every effort to ensure that the value of the second expression is never 0, however, if it is zero or the resulting value is outside
 * the value set defined by float (not including positive and negative infinity) then the operator should result in NULL.
