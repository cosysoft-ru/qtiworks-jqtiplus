/**
 * The integer modulus operator takes 2 sub-expressions which both have single cardinality and base-type integer.
 * The result is the single integer that corresponds to the remainder when the first expression (x)
 * is divided by the second expression (y). If z is the result of the corresponding integerDivide
 * operator then the result is x-z*y.
 * If y is 0, or if either of the sub-expressions is NULL then the operator results in NULL.
